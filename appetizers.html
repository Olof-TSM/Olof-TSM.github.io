            Description:
                The most amazing Toasted bread with garlic, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, basil topped with 
                tomatoes
            
            Ingredients
            •	1 loaf of Italian bread
            •	1 ½ pounds of tomatoes
            •	2 cloves of garlic
            •	1 Tablespoon of Balsamic Vinegar
            •	6-8 fresh basil leaves
            •	1 teaspoon of kosher salt
            •	½ teaspoon of ground black pepper
            •	¼ cup of olive oil
            •	500mL of ice water
            
            Step 1
                Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degree Celsius). Slice the Italian bread 
                horizontally into 1-inch slices. Mince 1 clove of garlic and brush onto the bread with the 
                olive oil on both sides. Make sure you save 1 Tbsp. of olive oil for later. Place it into 
                the oven for 5-6 minutes.
            
            Step 2
                Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. As the water heats up, prepare 500mL of ice 
                water in a small bowl and set it aside. Once the water is boiling, put the tomatoes in for 
                30 seconds. After 30 seconds take the tomatoes out and put them into the ice water for 
                another 30 seconds. Then gently slit the tomatoes and take the skin off.
            
            Step 3
                After peeling the tomato, slice into quarters and cut the seeds out. Once the seeds are out 
                dice the tomatoes. Place into a bowl and add 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 Tbsp. of olive oil,
                1 Tbsp. of balsamic vinegar, 1Tsp. of kosher salt, ½ Tsp, of ground black pepper and 6-8
                leaves of finely chopped basil. Mix well.
            
            Step 4
                Serve the bread and tomato mixture either separately or placing the mixture onto the bread.

            Yield: 4
            
            Prep time: 40 minutes
            Cook time: 20 minutes

            Country of origin: Italy
            
            Description:
                A stunning ricotta stuffed ravioli with an amazing lemon basil sauce.
                
            Ingredients
            Dough
            •	3 2/3 cups all purpose flour
            •	3 large eggs
            •	2 egg yolks
            •	1 Tbsp. olive oil (optional)
            Filling
            •	1 pound fresh ricotta (drain if wet)
            •	1 tsp. lemon zest
            •	1 cup grated parmesan cheese
            •	1 egg
            •	2 tsp. salt
            •	1 tsp. ground black pepper
            Sauce
            •	A stick of butter (1/2 cup) 
            •	8 basil leaves (chopped)
            •	Juice and zest of one lemon
                
            Step 1
                In a large bowl, pour in the flour and create a well in the center. Place the olive oil and 
                only two of the eggs and two egg yolks into the center of the well
                
            Step 2
                Start to whisk and slowly incorporate the flour into the mixture. Once the mixture thickens,
                 start to knead the dough by hand for 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. 
                 Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
                
            Step 3
                While the dough is resting, make the filling. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, 
                Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, salt, pepper and 1 egg. Mix until well combined and set aside.
                
            Step 4
                Split the dough into 4 individual pieces, and roll them out until they are 1/8 inch thick. 
                On a lightly floured surface, take 1 sheet and determine the mid-point. Beat 1 egg and 
                light wet one half of the dough. On the wet side of the dough, spoon about 2 tsp. of 
                filling leaving ½ inch between mounds.
                
            Step 5
                Fold the dry half over lengthwise to cover the filling. Press around the filling to seal 
                the edges together and squeeze out any air pockets. Use a pastry cutter or knife to 
                separate the ravioli and place on a floured tray or surface. Repeat for each piece of dough.
                
            Step 6
                Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Submerge the pasta and cook with the lid off. Cook 
                for 2-3 minutes until the pasta is tender. Drain and serve.
                
            Step 7
                Once the pasta is cooked, in a small saucepan melt a stick of butter and add the basil and 
                the juice and zest of 1 lemon. Add the cooked ravioli and cook in the sauce for an 
                additional 30 seconds. Serve and garnish with the left over sauce and fresh basil.

            Serving size: 3

            Time: 50 minutes
                
            Country of Origin: Italy 
                
            Description: 
            A silky smooth mushroom risotto with fresh parmesan cheese and basil.
                
            Step 1
                Pour the chicken broth in a small saucepan. Once the broth is brought to a simmer add the 
                mushrooms. Set aside for 5 minutes on low heat.
                
            Step 2
                Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add olive oil and onions and sauté for 
                around 8 minutes. After 8 minutes take the mushrooms out of the chicken broth onto a 
                cutting board. Finely chop the mushrooms and add them to the medium saucepan along with the 
                minced garlic. Sauté until the mushrooms are tender and the juices evaporate.
                
            Step 3
                Stir in the rice, after 1 minute add 1 cup of chicken broth. Continuously stir on a 
                medium-low heat until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender. Continue adding broth, 
                1 cup at a time until all 8 cups are gone. 
                
            Step 4
                Stir in some parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve and enjoy!
