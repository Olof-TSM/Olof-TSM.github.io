        For those who still want more, Victor Ramsay has compiled his first book full of his signitue dishes for purchase. This cookbook is the end product of an amazing experience. This journey started as a goal to experience different types of cuisines and foods from other cultures and most importantly, how I could cook them and enjoy them in my life. This all started with my passion for cooking as it is something I really enjoy to do. I have always enjoyed helping out in the kitchen but I have always stuck to traditionally Asian cuisine and food that I eat on a daily basis. This project was a perfect opportunity to push myself not only to try new foods from different cultures but creating them as well. Throughout this cookbook there are recipes from all around the world including France, Italy, Singapore, Mexico and many more. In addition, there are also a variety of flavors from savory dishes to sweets. The recipes in this book have all been altered through my experience in the kitchen and creating changes to ensure success every time. The difficulty of dishes also vary from ones that take more effort such as macrons to ones that can be created very quickly when you are in a rush such as tacos. This experience has changed the way I view food and has opened my eyes to so many new flavors and dishes I havenâ€™t thought about before. I hope this cookbook gives you some insight to the amazing journey I have been on through these past 3 months.
